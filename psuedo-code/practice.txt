This page is a page explaining the problems I had and how I learned to solve them.
At the bottom of the page is a bunch of psuedo-code I was throwing onto the page during the learning process.
I also included some notes explaining my thinking process.

Issues while coding:

- knowing what to connect to DOM
        Watched videos and followed along, made sure I understood what was going on
- images weren't displaying (pathing)
        Contacted tech-mentor to see what would cause broken images
- Writing functions
        It will get better overtime. Just kept practicing and rewriting them. (It got WAY better by the end of this)
- Figuring out how to make input box functional
        Got help from Jaylin. Realizing I'm way overcomplicating things. After this things started clicking in my brain.
-Input bot functional but calculations are off
         All I had to do was move my math.random equation above my Userinput if-else statements.. I dont want to talk about it. Took me 3 days to figure out.

Surely there is some way to condense my code, but I think writing it so many times was beneficial to me in the end.

// connect rock, paper, scissors, play again button, 
    // display box(form?)

// the computer needs to pick rock paper or scissors

// user clicks image to play rock, paper, or scissors
    // will need on click event listener

// user sees if they win or lose in the display box
    // will need an if else statement

// will need to write a function for probability ????
    // idek how to do this lol
    // math.random

    // KNOW HOW TO USE RANDOM



// let display = document.querySelector('.display')
// let rock = document.getElementById('#rock')
// let paper = document.getElementById('#paper')
// let scissors = document.getElementById('#scissors')
// let input = document.getElementById('#input')
// let playerValue = '';
// let playAgain = document.querySelector('')
// let testValue = '';
// const choices = ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]
// let img = document.getElementsByClassName('img')



// I know I need to add event listener

//if else -> if computer === 'rock'


// img.forEach(img => img.addEventListener('click',()  => {

// // userChoice = img.getAttribute(choices);

// }))


// this defines each choice the computer has to choose from


// function computerChoice(){ 
//     const randomNum = Math.floor(Math.random() * 3);  //math.floor so it rounds to a whole number and math random so it picks a random #
//     switch (randomNum) {
//         case 0:
//             testValue = choices[0];
//             break;
//         case 1:
//             testValue = choices[1];
//             break;
//         case 2:
//             testValue = choices[2];
//             break;
//     }
// }

else {
    if (you == "rock") {
        if (opponent == "scissors") {
            yourScore += 1;
        }
        else if (opponent == "paper") {
            opponentScore +=1;
        }
    }
    if (you == "rock") {
        if (opponent == "scissors") {
            yourScore += 1;
        }
        else if (opponent == "paper") {
            opponentScore +=1;
        }
    }
}
// for player do event listener at bottom of page
